# Setting Up Your Community
=========================

If you are reading this page, chances are you have completed the installation! If this is true, congratulations on successfully installing OpenCAD! In this section, we will be outlining **what to do after you install OpenCAD**.

On the Dashboard, requests to join the community are approved or rejected. Only moderators or administrators can approve or reject users.

 @@ User Management
---------------

Depending on your configurations, users should be able to register for accounts. To access users, log into your OpenCAD application and enter the Admin Dashboard. Once logged in, click on **User Management** from the navigation menu on the left of your screen.

This dashboard shows you statistics at a glance across all teams. Below this, a table of all users in the application is found. This table allows you to moderate all users easily.

The **Actions** column provides links to click on for the user in that row.
    
    ### Actions

*   **Edit** - Edit the current user's username, email, identifier, and user groups. (User groups are the departments they belong to.)
*   **Change Password** - Changes the current user's password.
*   **Change Role** - User / Moderator / Administrator. The administrator role is a _dangerous_ role to give to users. Only give it to people you trust.
*   **Delete** - delete's the row and account.
*   **Suspend without Reason** - moderate the user without attaching a reason.
*   **Suspend with Reason** - moderate the user and use the textbox to append the reasoning.
